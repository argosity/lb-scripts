This is a collection of scripts that peform various actions against the LegerBuddy API

Currently there are scripts that are used to load the demo data onto the demo website.

This is a pretty good example of how to create SKUs, Items, Purchase Orders, PO Receipts, Sales Orders, Pick Tickets, Invoices, and Inventory Adjustments.

All scripts are written in Ruby and use the Oauth2 for authentication.
